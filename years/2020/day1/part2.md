## Summary
Similarly to part 1, the problem is to find *three* numbers in the input list that add up to 2020. After find those, you would multiply them all together for the answer you would submit.

## General Tips
- Test often, and test with the examples
- Most of the time, the puzzle consists of parsing data to usable data, then doing something with that usable data
- Make sure the input is the same as it was from the website
- If it is taking a while to run, it may not be working right
- If all else fails, either take a break and come back to it later, or get some help.

## Specific Tips (SPOILERS)

- Like part 1, find a way to match every element to two others and see the result
