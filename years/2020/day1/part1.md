## Summary
The problem is to find two numbers in the input list that add up to 2020. After finding those two, you would multiply them to get the answer you would submit.

## General Tips
- Test often, and test with the examples
- Most of the time, the puzzle consists of parsing data to usable data, then doing something with that usable data
- Make sure the input is the same as it was from the website
- If it is taking a while to run, it may not be working right
- If all else fails, either take a break and come back to it later, or get some help.

## Specific Tips (SPOILERS)
<details> <summary>Spoiler warning!</summary>
- Try thinking about how to match each element with every other one and see what the result would be if you added them
- Since it is addition, you can try the opposite to find the number it would need to add to 2020 (ex. 2020 - 1721 = 299, like the example)
